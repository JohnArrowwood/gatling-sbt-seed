# The Source Directory

* **[/src/main](main)** - reusable code that is shared between your simulations
* **[/src/test](test)** - tests that verify that your reusable code does what it should
* **[/src/it](it)** - integration tests - your actual Gatling tests that exercise the Application Under Test

## Before You Begin

* Determine [what question you are trying to answer](../doc/what-are-you-testing.md)
* Familiarize yourself with the [Gatling fundamentals](../doc/gatling-fundamentals.md)
* Whether you are testing an [API](../doc/api-testing.md) or a [Web App](../doc/web-application-testing.md), decide what your [use cases](../doc/use-cases.md) and injection profiles are going to be

## As You Go

* Follow good [coding principles](../doc/coding-principles.md)
* [Organize your code](../doc/code-organization.md)
