# Application Scenarios

An Application groups related elements (APIs, UIs, etc.) together into a single system.  

Within each API or UI, the defined scenarios should be confined to working within that unit.

To define Scenarios that cross component boundaries, create them here.

NOTE: there is no technical reason why they have to be defined here.  If you add the necessary imports, you can get away with adding them wherever you like.  This folder and the rules are just a convention to ensure that the code is readible, and the behavior predictable.
